# squid-game

At first, I find the solution on paper. I realized that I can replace the numbers with 100 when I need to mark. after marking all items in a row or column, I change the 'win' property to 'true,' allowing me to identify the last board. After that I can easily calculate the total score. Following this, I create a 'convert.js' file to convert the cards and numbers in the structure I intend to use.
